# Power-Calculations
Python script to calculate powers of CRES trajectories in our guide, includes a number of analysis functions.

Download PowerCalcsNERSC.py and the two .pkl files to the same location to calculate powers of CRES electrons in the He6 CRES decay cell. 
Run `python PowerCalcNERSC.py Field L_rho frequency Harmonic`, where Field is the main field strength, L_rho is the number of rho positions sampled (typically I use 6), frequency is the cyclotron frequency, and Harmonic is the harmonic you want to calculate where 1 is the fundamental.
